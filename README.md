When I've first seen the Jetpack compose concept, I was really thinking that was it, no more XML, the future of Android is here (I still think so).
So, to try it out, I've decided to developpe this little application, not a really complex one, to simplify it, a TODO app, with category.

The original idea behind this app was to help me organise all the work needing to be done on my van, before it can take the road, and todo so i needed some features : 

* Having a list of TODO task
* Each one of this task is composed of different entries
* We can add or delete a task entries at any time, without constraint  
* The entries can be mark as done, and vice-versa
* The task need to be sorted by category
* A simple and readable UI

### Built With

* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)
* [ObjectBox](https://objectbox.io/)
* [Many jetpack libraries](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/explorer) Navigation, Material design ...
* [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/)
* [WhatIf](https://github.com/skydoves/WhatIf)
* [Slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/)
